        <h2>Jasmine</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/outdoor1.jpg" alt="jasmine flower">
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Picking the Perfect Place: Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. Jasmine thrives in at least 6-8 hours of bright, indirect sunlight daily. Avoid areas with constant shade or intense afternoon sun that can scorch the leaves.</li>
                <li>Planting Power: Amend the soil with organic matter like compost or aged manure for good drainage and increased nutrients. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball and plant your jasmine at the same depth it was growing in the container.</li>
                <li>Watering Wisely: Water regularly, especially during the first growing season, to establish a strong root system. Aim to keep the soil consistently moist, but not soggy. Allow the top inch of soil to dry slightly before watering again. As the plant matures, it becomes more drought-tolerant.</li>
                <li>Climbing Companion: Jasmine is a natural climber. Provide a trellis, fence, or other support structure for it to grow vertically. This allows for better air circulation and encourages blooming. You can also train jasmine to grow along walls or pergolas for a fragrant and visually appealing addition to your garden.</li>
                <li>Pruning for Perfection: Prune your jasmine regularly to encourage bushier growth and abundant flowering. Prune lightly after flowering has finished, removing any dead, diseased, or overgrown branches. You can also trim throughout the growing season to maintain a desired shape.</li>

        <h2>Rose</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/outdoor2.jpg" alt="rose flower">
        <p>
            
                <h3>Picking the Perfect Place</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Sunshine Seeker: Roses are sunshine lovers! Aim for at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Choose a well-ventilated spot with good air circulation to prevent disease.</li>
                <li>Soil Savvy: Roses prefer fertile, well-draining soil. Amend your existing soil with compost or organic matter to improve drainage and nutrient content. A slightly acidic soil pH (around 6.5) is ideal.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Planting Powerhouse</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Bare-Root Beauties: If planting bare-root roses (dormant plants without soil), soak them in water for several hours before planting.</li>
                <li>Digging Deep: Dig a hole at least twice the width of the root ball. Spread the roots out and ensure the bud union (the swollen area where the stem meets the roots) is slightly above the soil level.</li>
                <li>Watering Wisely: Water deeply after planting and regularly throughout the growing season, especially during hot weather. Aim to keep the soil consistently moist, but not soggy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Keeping it Thriving</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Mulch Magic: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of organic mulch around the base of your rose bush to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.</li>
                <li>Fertilizing Friend: Feed your roses with a balanced rose fertilizer during spring and summer, following the product instructions. Avoid overfertilizing, which can encourage weak growth and disease.</li>
                <li>Pruning Power: Regular pruning promotes healthy growth, flowering, and air circulation. Prune in late winter or early spring before new growth appears. Remove dead, diseased, or crossed branches. Consider taking out some healthy branches to encourage bushier growth and better airflow.</li>
                <li>Deadheading Delight: Deadheading (removing spent blooms) encourages continuous flowering throughout the season. Simply cut the stem back to a healthy outward-facing bud.</li>
                
                </ul>

        <h2>Lavender</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/outdoor3.png" alt="Lavender flower">
        <p>
            <h3>Sun Seeker: </h3> Lavender thrives in full sun, aiming for at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. This helps promote healthy growth and abundant flowering.
            <h3>Drainage Delight: </h3>Choose a well-draining potting mix or prepare your garden bed with sandy or loamy soil. Lavender dislikes soggy roots, so good drainage is essential to prevent root rot.
            <h3>Watering Wisely:</h3> Water moderately, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot. Lavender tolerates drought conditions better than overwatering.
            <h3>Feeding Frenzy (Not Really):</h3> Lavender doesn't require frequent fertilization. A light application of balanced fertilizer once during spring is sufficient. Avoid overfertilizing, as it can encourage excessive leaf growth and limit flowering.
            <h3>Pruning Power:</h3> Regular pruning encourages bushier growth and promotes more flowers. Prune lightly after flowering to maintain a compact shape and remove spent blooms. Heavier pruning can be done in late winter or early spring before new growth appears.
            <h3>Harvesting Happiness: </h3>Once your lavender blooms, you can harvest the flower stalks for fresh use or drying. Cut the stems just below the flower head when the blooms are almost fully open, but not yet fully spent.
