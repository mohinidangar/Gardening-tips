        <h2>Peace Lily</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/indoor1.jpg" alt="peace_lily">
        <p><h3>Finding a Happy Place</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Light: Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid harsh afternoon sun that can scorch the leaves. North or east-facing windows are ideal.</li>
              <li>Temperature: These tropical plants enjoy warmth, thriving in temperatures between 60°F (16°C) and 80°F (27°C). Keep them away from cold drafts and air conditioners.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Planting and Watering</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Choosing a Pot: Pick a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. Consider a decorative pot with a saucer to catch excess water.</li>
              <li>Planting Mix: Use a well-draining potting mix specifically formulated for indoor plants.</li>
              <li>Watering Wisely: Peace lilies like consistently moist soil, but not soggy. Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry. Let the excess water drain out before placing the pot back in its saucer. Drooping leaves are a sign of thirst, so water thoroughly when that happens.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Keeping it Thriving</h3>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Humidity Boost: Peace lilies love humidity. Mist the leaves regularly, especially during summer. Alternatively, place the pot on a pebble tray filled with water (keep the pebbles above the water level).</li>
              <li>Fertilizing Friend: Feed your peace lily with a balanced houseplant fertilizer during spring and summer, following the product instructions.</li>
              <li>Cleaning Up: Occasionally wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and promote better light absorption.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Bonus Tip: Peace lilies don't require frequent repotting. Only repot when the roots outgrow the current pot, typically every 2-3 years.</p></p>

        <h2>Spider Plant</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/indoor2.jpg" alt="spider_plant">
        <p>
            <h3>Planting:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Potting Mix: Use a well-draining, soil-based potting mix.</li>
<li>Watering: Spider plants prefer consistent moisture, avoid letting them dry out completely or become soggy.</li>
<li>Sunlight: Provide bright to moderate indirect sunlight. Avoid harsh, direct sunlight.</li>
<li>Repotting: Repot your spider plant every 1-2 years when it becomes pot-bound.</li>
<li>Outdoor Placement (Optional): Grow spider plants outdoors as annuals in summer, keeping them out of direct sunlight. They look great along edges of containers or beds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Growing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watering Frequency: Water occasionally during initial growth, then moderately once mature (within a year).</li>
<li>Spring/Summer Watering: Keep the soil moist during spring and summer to encourage growth, but avoid overwatering.</li>
<li>Temperature and Humidity: Maintain average room temperature and humidity. Ideal temperatures range between 55 and 80°F (13–27°C).</li>
<li>Fertilization: Fertilize twice a month during spring and summer, but avoid overfertilizing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Harvesting Pups (Propagating):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pups: Healthy spider plants may produce "pups" (offshoots). These can be removed and replanted to create new plants.</li>
<li>Pup Removal Timing: Allow pups to reach about 2 inches in diameter before separating them from the mother plant.</li>
<li>Alternative Propagation: You can also leave the pups attached and place pots of soil next to the mother plant. Once rooted, they can be severed from the mother plant.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Snake Plant</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/indoor3.jpg" alt="snake_plant">
        <p>
            <h3>Finding the Perfect Spot</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Light: Snake plants are low-light champions, thriving in bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid harsh, direct sun that can scorch leaves.</li>
            <li>Temperature: These desert natives prefer warmth, doing well between 65°F (18°C) and 85°F (29°C). Protect them from cold drafts and sudden temperature changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Potting Up for Success</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Choosing a Pot: Select a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot. A pot slightly larger than the root ball is ideal. Snake plants prefer being slightly root-bound.</li>
            <li>Planting Mix: Use a well-draining cactus or succulent potting mix. Regular potting mix can retain too much moisture.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Watering Wisely (Less is More!)</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Watering Schedule: Snake plants are drought-tolerant. Water deeply only when the soil feels completely dry to the touch. Overwatering is a major threat.</li>
            <li>Drainage is Key: Ensure excess water drains freely from the pot. Never let your snake plant sit in water.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Minimal Maintenance Magic</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Fertilizer: Fertilize sparingly during spring and summer with a diluted balanced houseplant fertilizer. Follow package instructions and avoid overfertilizing.</li>
            <li>Cleaning Up: Wipe down leaves with a damp cloth occasionally to remove dust.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>ZZ plant</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/indoor4.jpg" alt="zz_plant">
        <p>
             <h3>Light:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>ZZ plants are famous for tolerating low light conditions. They will grow slower in low light, but are perfect for north-facing windows or areas a few feet from a window with indirect light.</li>
              <li>However, they thrive in moderate levels of indirect, bright light and can even tolerate some direct morning sunlight. Avoid prolonged periods of direct afternoon sun, which can scorch leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Water:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>ZZ plants are drought-tolerant, perfect for forgetful waterers. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings.</li>
              <li>Water only when the soil is bone dry. Overwatering is the main cause of ZZ plant death. Check the soil moisture or wait for the plant to show signs of dryness (wilting).</li>
              <li>Water deeply but infrequently, roughly every 2-3 weeks. Ensure excess water drains from the pot.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Temperature and Humidity:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>ZZ plants aren't picky about temperature and humidity. Standard household conditions (60-80°F and average humidity) are fine. A slightly more humid, warm room will make them happier due to their tropical origins.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Soil:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>No need to overthink it! A standard, well-draining potting mix is perfect. Cactus or succulent mix can also work.</li>
              <li>Choose a pot with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging. Heavy, wet soil is the one thing ZZ plants can't tolerate.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Propagation:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>ZZ plants are popular for propagation. You can snip off leaflets to grow new ZZ plants. This is the easiest method.</li>
              <li>Using pruning shears, remove a few leaves from the stalk, cutting as close to the stalk as possible. (Use multiple leaves for higher success rates.)</li>
              <li>Place the leaves in a shallow pot with potting mix, pushing the base of the leaf into the soil while keeping most of it exposed.</li>
              <li>Water the soil to moisten it, but avoid overwatering.</li>
              <li>Keep the pot in a warm, bright location. Water again when the soil dries out.</li>
              <li>After a few months, roots will develop, followed by small, potato-like rhizomes. Once these appear, you can repot your new ZZ plant into a larger pot.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Common Problems and Pests:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Yellow leaves can indicate overwatering or underwatering. Adjust your watering schedule to restore healthy green leaves.</li>
            </ul></p>

        <h2>Money Plant</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/indoor5.jpg" alt="money_plant">
        <p>
            <h3>Light it Up (But Not Too Much):</h3>Money plants prefer bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid harsh, direct sun that can scorch leaves. East or north-facing windows are ideal.
            <h3>Watering Wisdom:</h3> Money plants thrive on consistent moisture, but not soggy soil. Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry. Allow excess water to drain freely. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
            <h3>Humidity Helper: </h3>Money plants appreciate a humid environment, especially during dry seasons. Mist the leaves regularly or place the pot on a pebble tray filled with water (keep the pebbles above the water level).
            <h3>Climbing Companion:</h3> Money plants are natural climbers. Provide a moss pole or trellis for them to climb, or allow them to cascade gracefully from a hanging basket.
